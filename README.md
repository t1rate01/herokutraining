# Assignment for school
This repository is cloned and edited from a tutorial [here](heroku-training-schoolassignme](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).
The assignments main purpose was to deploy a simple "Hello world" style application to deploy to Heroku and to setup
a GitHub repository pipeline and see it work. The application is no longer online and this repository/fork will likely be soon deleted.
